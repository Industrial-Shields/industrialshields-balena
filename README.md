# Industrial Shields PLC Raspberry Pi on balena 

This is an example on how to run the Industrial Shields PLC Raspberry Pi 4 on balenaOS.

## Description

[Industrial Shields PLC Raspberry Pi](https://www.industrialshields.com/es_ES/industrial-plc-pac-raspberry-pi-202009) is an industrial single board computer that guarantees adaptability to all types of sensors, data, and communication options. The key features include improved processing speed, an uninterrumped power supply, real-time clock, a wide range of connections such as dual Ethernet ports, dual RS-485, WiFi, Bluetooth and more, including up to 36 Digital Inputs, up to 16 Analog Inputs, up to 22 Digital Outputs, up to 8 Analog Outputs, up to 23 Relays and up to 6 Interrupt Inputs.

In this example project we use the [balena platform](https://balena.io) to deploy the required libraries to use all the connections and IO capabilities of the Industrial Shields PLC Raspberry Pi. Find also deployed Node-RED along the Industrial Shields libraries to quickstart with your first industrial prototypes with Node-RED.

The balena platform enables provisioning, updating the software and OS, and managing large fleets of industrial devices from balenaCloud. 

## Requirements

For this project I'm using: 

* the [Industrial Shields PLC Raspberry Pi 4 v4 Model 21](https://www.industrialshields.com/es_ES/shop/raspberry-plc-21-2230?attrib=73-416&view_mode=grid#attr=2607,702,743,4073,534,7119,7120,143,5807,4218,4219,4220)
* the [Industrial Shields Power Supply](https://www.industrialshields.com/es_ES/shop/is-ac12vdc2-5adin-fuente-alimentacion-carril-din-30w-12v-salida-659?attrib=49-456&view_mode=grid#attr=3657)
* a Modbus Temperature and Humidity sensor 

* a [balena account](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/signup) - free for up to 10 devices
* [balenaEtcher](https://etcher.balena.io/)
* and a SD card


## Deploy

You have two options here:

### One-click deploy via balena Deploy

Use the button below to create your fleet (of one or more devices) and deploy the code.

[![](https://balena.io/deploy.svg)](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/deploy?repoUrl=https://github.com/mpous/industrialshields-balena)

If you don't have a balenaCloud account, no worries, you will create it after clicking the `Deploy with balena` button.


### Deploy via balena CLI

Or, you can create an application in your balenaCloud dashboard and balena push this code to it the traditional way installing the [balena CLI](https://www.balena.io/docs/reference/balena-cli/).

- Sign up on [balena.io](https://dashboard.balena.io/signup)
- Create a new fleet on balenaCloud.

Now open a Terminal on your computer:

```
cd ~/workspace
git clone https://github.com/mpous/industrialshields-balena
cd industrialshields-balena
```

- Using [Balena CLI](https://www.balena.io/docs/reference/cli/), push the code with `balena push <your-fleet-name>`
- See the magic happening, your device is getting updated ðŸŒŸOver-The-AirðŸŒŸ!

## Add a device

Once the release is successfully built on your fleet in balenaCloud, click `Add device`.

And select the device type `Raspberry Pi 4 (using 64bit OS)` balenaOS version. Add the Wi-Fi credentials if needed, and click `Flash` or `Download` the balenaOS image.

Use balenaEtcher to flash the SD card with the balenaOS image.

### Add the custom dtbo of Industrial Shields

Download the Industrial Shields Raspberry Pi PLC `dtbo` overlay file to add to the OS image. [Click here to download the latest dtbo file](https://apps.industrialshields.com/main/rpi/rpiplc_click_v4/sc16is752-spi1-rpiplc-v4.dtbo).

Once flashed, connect the SD to your computer to add an extra `dtbo` file into the `overlays` folder of the balenaOS. The unit is called `resin-boot`.

Once the file is properly saved on the SD card, connect the SD card into the Rasberry Pi 4 PLC and power it up.


### Node-RED

For running Node-RED, use the local IP address on port 80, if you are on the same network than your device. You also can use the `Publick Device URL` by balena to access to the Node-RED UI.

#### Device Variables

In case they do not exist, add these variables at balenaCloud at device level using `Device Variables` or at a Fleet level at `Variables` for all the devices.

Variable Name | Default | Description
------------ | ------------- | -------------
PORT | `80` | the port that exposes the Node-RED UI
USERNAME | `balena` | the Node-RED admin username
PASSWORD | `balena` | the Node-RED admin password
ENCRIPTION_KEY | `balena` | the encription key used to store your credentials files

[image]

You **must** set the `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` variables to be able to access, save or run programs in Node-RED.  

#### Add the rpiplc node

Once you access to the Node-RED UI, go to the top-right menu and click `Manage pallette` and then go to the `Install` tab to find and install the Industrial Shields PLC node.

Search `librpiplc` and you might find the industrial shields bindings for Node-RED. Click install.
